 *   Generic code for controlling a brushed DC motor
 *   Inverting PIN+ and PIN- of the motor will only revers the turning direction
 *   You can connect direcly the motor's PINs to Arduino (not reccomended)
 *   For better result use an external power source with an H bridge using his inputs in the same way of the DC motor PINs
